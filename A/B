How do I evaluate A / B (mod 1000000007)?
When working with prime moduli it's often easiest, from an implementation perspective, 
to find the inverse using modular exponentiation. (I personally find this algorithm easier to write and it performs similarly)
For example, compute ab−1(modp) as abp−2(modp) (making use of Fermat's little theorem
